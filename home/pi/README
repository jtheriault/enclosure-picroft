Picroft development image
=========================

This image provides a quick getting-started to Mycroft.  This is a Raspian
Jessie Lite image with Mycroft pre-installed and configured to operate with:
  * Headphones or speaker plugged into the Pi's headphone jack
  * USB microphone

If you wish audio to go out the HDMI -- e.g. if you have your Pi plugged in
to a TV and you want to use its speaker -- you can edit the auto_run.sh
script and follow the instructions give there.

If you wish to use Wifi instead of an ethernet connection, you can run the
configure_wifi.sh script.  This will start the Mycroft wifi setup process.
You only need to do this once, and it begins automatically on boot if no
network is detected.

Picroft will automatically check for updates daily and will also check for 
updates on each reboot.


Additional commands you can use from the command line:
   cli - Starts a command line Mycroft client.  Just type instead of talking,
              watch log output, see microphone levels, etc.

   say_to_mycroft - One-shot method of "saying" something to Mycroft from the
              command line

   speak - Perfrom Text to Speech from the command line
   
   view_log - Continuously displays the log of what Mycroft is hearing and
              saying to you.

   test_microphone - Performs a brief recording and playback to test that
              your equipment is functioning correctly

   msm install <repo> - Install a skill from Github, e.g.
              msm install https://github.com/ethanaward/demo_skill.git
